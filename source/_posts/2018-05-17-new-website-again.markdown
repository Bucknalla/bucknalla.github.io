I've been messing around with website designs that I like (again... I know) and finally settled on something simple that I like. The new site is built on top of the Jekyll framework making it easier to upload content. Hopefully the new and improved website will encourage me to write more blog posts, documenting my research and personal projects.

I intend to restart my blog posts; aiming to write something every week and telling myself that it's ok to write a short blog post. I think I'll aim for one large post and 3 smaller ones every month. Hopefully that's not too optimistic!

Drop me a comment if there's anything in particular you'd like me to discuss/explore in these blog posts, relating to FPGAs, SDRs and IoT!
