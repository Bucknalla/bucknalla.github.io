I am a **PhD(c) Researcher** at the University of Warwick's [Adaptive and Reconfigurable Computing Group](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/eng/research/grouplist/connectedsystems/warc/), part of the Communication Systems Lab. My research consists of lots of **FPGAs**, **SDRs** and everything **IoT**; I occasionally write blog posts and publish short content on things I find interesting in my field. I've previously worked at number of startups, including [Pycom](https://pycom.io), [Sigfox](https://sigfox.com) and [Major League Hacking](https://mlh.io).

In between my research, I also provide contacting/consulting for businesses looking to integrate/implement IoT systems. If you'd like to reach out to me about contracting interest, please head over to the [contact](/contact) page to get in touch.

If you want to checkout some of the projects/research that I'm working on, head over to my [GitHub](https://github.com/jglovier/jekyll-new) profile, where I typically publish my latest work.

Additionally, I'm most active on [twitter](https://twitter.com/AlexRBucknall) so feel free to tweet me!
